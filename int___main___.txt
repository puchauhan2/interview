Re-Host Each application is migrated “As-is”. Often referred to as a “Lift-and-shift” migration, this option does not require code changes

Re-Plaform : Infrastructure / OS upgrades will be required on source workloads before migration

RE-factro : Often referred to as "repackaging," refactoring requires minimal changes to applications so that they can be compatible to Cloud hosting
